          <p>The Eduardo Paolozzi mural is revealed as demolition work takes place.</p>
          <p>Tourists heading to Berlin for a culture fix this spring will not have 
                  to pay an entrance fee to a gallery to view the German capital’s 
                  best-kept art secret.</p>
          <p>On the corner of Kurfürstenstrasse and Budapester Strasse, just across 
                  from the Berlin aquarium, visitors can admire a rarely seen black 
                  and white work by the pop art pioneer Eduardo Paolozzi, lost to 
                  the world for three decades until its re-emergence earlier this 
                  year.</p>
          <p>The exhibition will not be accepting offers from willing buyers, 
                  however – mainly because the canvas is a 990 sq metre concrete 
                  wall – and in any case is due to shut down permanently over the 
                  next few months.</p>
          <p>Painted on the side of a building in 1976 to mark the end of the Scottish 
                  artist’s one-year stay in Berlin, the mural was soon covered up by 
                  banking offices that are currently being demolished, thus briefly 
                  revealing its retro-futuristic curves just as a smaller replica of 
                  the same work is on display at the Berlinische Galerie on the other 
                  side of the city.</p>

          <p>By the summer of 2020, Paolozzi’s painting will again disappear behind 
                  a new 60-metre high office building with an all-glass facade and 
                  a large rooftop terrace, making it part of a growing number of iconic 
                  murals that are vanishing from Berlin’s cityscape as developers fill 
                  in the empty lots carved out by second world war bombs.</p>
          <p>A political triptych between Savignyplatz and Zoologischer Garten metro 
                  stations, featuring Marx and Engels gazing down sceptically from 
                  a cloud, is due to disappear behind a block of “micro apartments” 
                  aimed at “business commuters and singles”, scheduled for completion 
                  next year.</p>
          <p>Even the days of a mural that once inspired a wave of more than 200 similar 
                  artworks across west Berlin are numbered. A real estate developer is 
                  building his new offices at Tiergarten station directly in front of 
                  Ben Wagin’s so-called Weltbaum or “world tree” mural, a composite of 
                  several artists’ paintings warning of the threat of environmental 
                  destruction.</p>
          <p>When Wagin painted his mural in 1975, Berlin discovered wall paintings as an 
                  opportunity to brighten up a city still associated with cold war drabness. 
                  Paolozzi’s work, conceived in the same year, came out of a competition 
                  sponsored and initiated by the Berlin senate.</p>
          <p>Soon, though, local authorities began to worry that allowing artists to paint 
                  copyrighted works on the side of buildings could create obstacles for 
                  urban regeneration: from 1976 onwards, many artists who were commissioned 
                  had to sign a waiver saying what they had painted was not a work of art.

          <p>As a result, the senate now professes ignorance about the artworks that 
                  have shaped Berlin’s visual identity in the eyes of the world. While 
                  Paolozzi’s mosaics at Tottenham Court Road tube station in London were 
                  painstakingly restored during the station’s recent renovation, no mention 
                  had to be made of Paolozzi’s mural in the planning application for the 
                  “Westlight” office block, and a spokesperson at the investor Barings said 
                  there were no plans to make the mural visible from outside or within the 
                  new structure.</p>
          <p>“We try to work hand in hand with developers to save Paolozzi’s heritage 
                  whenever we can,” said Toby Treves, a trustee of the Scottish artist’s 
                  foundation and a former Tate curator. “The difficulty with public art is 
                  that we no longer know who is responsible for a lot of it.”</p>
          <p>Norbert Martins, a local historian and photographer who has spent the last 40 
                  years documenting the story of Berlin street art, said: “Many artists 
                  recognise that their murals were always going to be temporary, and that 
                  you can’t protect them.</p>
          <p>“But the senate isn’t coming anywhere near to exhausting the potential of its 
                  street art for tourism. Cities like Lyon and Brussels show it could be done 
                  very differently. At least with the original mural the senate could have made 
                  sure that it will be reproduced elsewhere.”</p>
          <p>Wagin has a similar belief in the essential transience of all street art. “Cities 
                  are sandpits: you spend ages building your beautiful little castle, and then 
                  comes the flood and washes it all away,” said the 88-year-old artist. “That’s 
                  how it goes with art in cities.”</p>
          <p>However, he has not lost hope that his “world tree” painting could be replanted 
                  somewhere else. A group of younger street artists have already announced 
                  their willingness to paint a slightly modified version of Wagin’s classic 
                  at another location in the city.</p>
          <p>Inhabitants of a building on Albrechtstrasse have reportedly offered up their wall, 
                  which is clearly visible from Friedrichstrasse station. And the investor whose 
                  building project will cover up the original has agreed to donate scaffolding 
                  and painting equipment.</p>
